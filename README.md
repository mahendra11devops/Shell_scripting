In Jenkins, build options can be customized and configured to suit a variety of project needs. Here are some common build options and settings you can configure in Jenkins:

1. Source Code Management (SCM)
Git: Configure your project to pull code from a Git repository. Options include setting the repository URL, credentials, branches to build, etc.
Subversion: Configure SVN repository details.
Other SCMs: Support for CVS, Mercurial, Perforce, etc., is available through plugins.
2. Build Triggers
Poll SCM: Jenkins periodically checks the repository for changes.
Build Periodically: Schedule builds at specified intervals using cron-like syntax.
GitHub Hook Trigger: Trigger builds based on GitHub events like pushes.
Trigger builds remotely: Start a build using a URL (with an authentication token).
Build after other projects are built: Set up build dependencies.
3. Build Environment
Abort the build if itâ€™s stuck: Set a timeout to abort long-running builds.
Delete workspace before build starts: Clean the workspace to avoid conflicts from previous builds.
Use secret text(s) or file(s): Manage sensitive information securely.
4. Build Steps
Execute Shell/Batch Command: Run shell or batch scripts.
Invoke Ant: Use Apache Ant for building Java projects.
Invoke Gradle: Use Gradle for building Java projects.
Invoke Maven: Use Maven for managing and building Java projects.
Execute Windows Batch Command: Run Windows batch scripts.
Run other jobs: Trigger other Jenkins jobs as part of the build process.
5. Post-build Actions
Archive the artifacts: Store build outputs (e.g., binaries, logs) for later retrieval.
Publish JUnit test result report: Display test results.
Email Notifications: Send build status notifications to specified recipients.
Build other projects: Trigger other jobs upon the completion of the current job.
Record fingerprints of files: Track files through builds.
Deploy: Use plugins to deploy applications (e.g., to a server or cloud environment).
6. Pipeline Options
For Jenkins Pipelines (both scripted and declarative), additional options are available:

Pipeline Script: Write your pipeline as code using Groovy.
Pipeline Script from SCM: Retrieve the pipeline script from a source code repository.
Declarative Pipeline: Define your pipeline using a simpler syntax.
7. Parameters
String Parameter: Accept a text string.
Boolean Parameter: A checkbox for true/false.
Choice Parameter: A dropdown list of options.
File Parameter: Upload a file to the build.
Credentials Parameter: Use credentials securely.
8. Security and Permissions
Job-specific security: Control who can configure, build, or access the job.
Credentials: Manage secrets and sensitive information securely.
9. Plugins
Jenkins' functionality can be extended via plugins. Some common ones include:

Blue Ocean: A modern interface for Jenkins.
GitHub Integration: Improved integration with GitHub.
Slack Notifications: Send build notifications to Slack.
Docker: Build, test, and deploy Docker images.
